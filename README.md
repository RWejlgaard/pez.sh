## Description

This is my personal website.

## Hosting

The hosting of this website has changed numerous times.

At first it was hosted on a raspberry pi behind my couch.

Then I graduated to hosting at Firebase, since the dynamic IP of my ISP kept pulling the site offline.

That got a little boring after a while, so I went to hosting a multi-cluster kubernetes setup which in it's peak had a total of 9 nodes across 5 different cities around the world (London, Copenhagen, Paris, Japan & West US).

Currently, the site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages, where I think I'll leave it for a while.
